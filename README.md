# Banking System

## Local environment setup

Before everything please clone the project and install node JS in your local coumputer. Version used here is,

### `v18.17.0`

I recommend using `nvm` to insall the `NodeJS` so you ca have multiple versions in your local environment. Now let's get the project from git using the fllowing command.

```
git clone git@github.com:Prabashi/banking-system.git
```

In the project directory, please run:

```
npm install
```

Now run the application

```
npm run dev
```

## Production run
